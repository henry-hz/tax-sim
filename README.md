### Quick next step

If you want, I’ll generate the **Google Sheets / Excel template** you asked about that implements the same comparisons for these 10 platforms (one sheet that computes side-by-side sole-proprietor vs Ltd). Specify which input fields you want included (I suggest: annual revenue, deductible expenses, VAT-registered Y/N, owner salary if Ltd, employer NII %, pension rates, dividend rate). I can build it immediately.
